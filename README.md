# RPG
I'm just playing around with making a game.
The visual design is low on my todo list so please forgive the appearance it's the bare minimum to test functionality.
Jquery is being used. I started with vanilla JS and had to refactor a few hundred lines of code.
I'm trying to refactor to be more MVC and to be a more functional style
